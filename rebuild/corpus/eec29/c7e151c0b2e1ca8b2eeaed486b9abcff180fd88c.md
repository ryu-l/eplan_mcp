# Entering values for structure parameters IO_Place, IO_Places, and IO_IncomingBus in Function groups

Previously, formulas were entered for the structure parameters for the installed actuators and sensors. By means of these formulas, these actuators and sensors obtain their values from the parent [Function](glossary_o_fc.htm) unit. The Function units obtain these values, in turn, from their corresponding parent Function group.

First, the formulas are entered into all installed Function units:

1. Open the Insert Function group.
2. Select the installed Separator Function unit.
3. Select the parameters IO\_IncomingBus, IO\_Place, and IO\_Places.
4. Select the Add Interface Parameter item from the popup menu.
5. Repeat steps 1 to 4 for the installed Stack Function unit.
6. Open the Parameter editor of the Insert Function group.
7. For the IO\_IncomingBus parameter, enter the value IO.
8. For the IO\_Place and IO\_Places parameters, enter the value PLC.
9. Repeat steps 1 to 8 for the Inspect Function group with the installed Orientationinspector Function unit and for the Move Function group with the installed X\_Axis, Y\_Axis, and Gripper Function units.
