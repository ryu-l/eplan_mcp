# content()

Data source objects

Delivers a list of all objects of the standard data source table. Each object represents a row of this table. These objects can be accessed by methods that match the column names of the table. For calculated column names the method property(<column name>) is available. For large amounts of data the access with [perform(String sqlStatement)](refformulas_r_datasourceobjects_perform.htm) is to be preferred.
