# open

The element <open> opens a Form-UI page or an Internet page. The element can be represented by an image by means of the img attribute (see also [img](refformui_r_img.htm)).

For the representation of a link as a button it is possible to use a shortcut in order to follow the link without clicking (see also [Shortcuts](refformui_r_shortcuts.htm)).

The text for a link can comprise the text defined with the attribute text and the text between the opening tag and the closing tag. The text of the attribute and the text between the tags is delimited by a space and any spaces, tabs and line breaks that may be present are removed.

If the component exists but the reference with ref="Reference-ID" is wrong or not existing, an appropriate error message is displayed (see the following figure).
